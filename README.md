# SikuliDriverServer
Sikuli through WebDriver or a webdriver-compatible server for Sikuli

This project under development. No basic working code yet, although there is code you can work off of, it's almost complete. Just needs fixing and patching. Community contributions appreciated.

Please see the wiki pages in this repo for more details beyond the code.
